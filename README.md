#### Starting with nothing but extinct.


```
Alright! After creating a random webpage, I have finally decided to create a game like I have always wanted to so I can package them together.
Tool I am doing to be using is RPG Maker MZ, which is almost a beginner friendly software to create old gen pixel games.

It is a simple tool that used Javascript to get the scripting done. Maps are designed with the the pencil tool and uses speicfic assets to use in game.
Very simple to use but fun all together.

Going to keep the log here to keep muself motivated to finish this. Going to spend 1 week working on it starting from 2023-04-12.
```

### Day 1 

Created 2 maps still incomplete. Narrative for the game will be worked on tomorrow.

### Day 2

Alright, fun day! Created into narrative of the game which I will not share here currently.
Decided to take the genre into Mystery, not much has been finalized yet but will keep it to minimal
gameplay but will reward players who will put their time into exploring and learn what really is going on.
